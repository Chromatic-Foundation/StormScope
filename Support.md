Need help with StormScope X? We’ve got you covered! 

Here are some tips for troubleshooting:
- Ensure all images and audio files are placed correctly in the "images/" folder and the extension directory.
- For 3D Simulator issues, make sure your browser supports HTML5 Canvas and audio playback.
- Check that your browser allows iframes, as Chase Mode relies on embedded radar maps from Windy.com.

We aim to respond promptly and help you enjoy StormScope X to its fullest!
