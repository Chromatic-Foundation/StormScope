StormScope X is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. 

The extension uses only the following data for functionality: 
- Country selections made by the user to display tornado information.
- Embedded radar maps from Windy.com, displayed via iframe, which do not track personal user information. 

All audio files (wind.mp3 and Tornado Siren.mp3) and images are stored locally within the extension folder on your device and do not communicate with any external servers. No data about your activity or choices is transmitted or stored externally.

StormScope X is designed solely for educational, entertainment, and weather awareness purposes. Users should not rely on the extension as a professional weather alert system. Always follow local authorities’ guidance in case of severe weather.

By using this extension, you agree to these terms and consent to using the extension safely and responsibly.
